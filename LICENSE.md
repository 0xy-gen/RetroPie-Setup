## Common Questions
**Q. Can I include RetroPie with my product?**
A. No. RetroPie is not licensed for commercial use. Using RetroPie as a "freebie" or including it at "no cost" with your product still constitutes commercial usage and is forbidden by the license.

**Q. Can I sell my product with the RetroPie logo on it?**
A. No. Putting the logo on your product makes it appear that the product is something officially endorsed by Florian Müller, and constitutes trademark infringement.

**Q. Can I use the RetroPie logo to advertise my product?**
A. No. Using the logo in your advertising makes it appear that the product is something officially endorsed by Florian Müller, and constitutes trademark infringement.

**Q. Can I use the term „RetroPie“ in the name of my software?**
A. Generally, no, especially if it is something that is sold. However, if you are producing a free RetroPie-related piece of software, it is common that permission is granted. Send a query to double-check first, please.

**Q. How do I obtain a license to the RetroPie source code?**
A. You can't. See the Copyright section above.

**Q. Is it legal to download ROMs for a game when I own the PCB?**
A. This is unclear and depends on where you live. In most cases you would need to obtain permission from the original manufacturer to do so.

**Q. Is this license similar to the MAME license?**
A. Yes. Even though MAME and RetroPie are quite different things from a technical point of view both projects are strongly related to gaming and possible ROMs usage. We believe that that license is very suitable for RetroPie.
